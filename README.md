## How It Works: The Tech Stack

TarotMeow is built with a modern web stack, combining a powerful Python backend with a dynamic frontend.

* **Backend:**
  * **Framework:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
  * **AI:** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)
  * **Localization:** [Flask-Babel](https://python-babel.github.io/flask-babel/)
  * **Server:** [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) for production

* **Frontend:**
  * HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
  * [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) for rendering Markdown in the browser.

## Local Development Setup

Want to run TarotMeow on your own machine? Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eyrexh/TarotMeow.git
   cd TarotMeow
   ```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create Your Environment File:**

   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your Gemini API key. You can have multiple keys.

   ```dotenv
   GEMINI_API_KEY_1="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   GEMINI_API_KEY_2="ANOTHER_API_KEY_HERE"
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY="ANY_RANDOM_STRONG_SECRET_KEY"
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python3 app/main.py
   ```

   The app will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Deployment

This application is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/). The `Procfile` instructs Render to use `gunicorn` to run the Flask application. Environment variables (like the API keys) are configured securely in the Render dashboard.

Auto-deployment is enabled, so any push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new build and update the live site.
